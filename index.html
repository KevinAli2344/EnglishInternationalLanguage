              <h2>English Language and Technological Inventions</h2>
              <p>Language contributes to technology in numerous ways including the creation of new words, new grammar rules, acronyms, and expressions. Acronyms are words created using only the initial letters of words that describe an object or a process. Examples include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>CD-ROM: Compact Disc Read Only Memory</li>
                <li>USB: Universal Serial Bus</li>
                <li>DVD: Digital Versatile Disc</li>
                <li>LED: Light Emitting Diode</li>
                <li>LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation</li>
                <li>GPS: Global Positioning System</li>
                <li>HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</li>
                <li>LCD: Liquid Crystal Display</li>
                <li>RAM: Random Access Memory</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Expressions like "going online" reflect the integration of technology into daily life.</p>

              <h2>The Early Years</h2>
              <p>In the Middle Ages, technology was closely related to military innovations. Examples include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Arrow: Originated from Middle English "arwe," from Old English "Ä“arw-" and Proto-Germanic "*arhwo."</li>
                <li>Sword: Derived from Old English and Proto-Indo-European "*swer-" meaning "to wound or cut."</li>
                <li>Cannon: From 12th-century Old French "trebuchet," meaning "siege engine."</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Renaissance (1350-1650) marked a transitional period where inventions like the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized communication.</p>

              <p>The Internet originated as ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) and became public on August 6, 1991.

              <h2>Technology in English Learning</h2>
              <p>Since the 1960s, computers and technology have enhanced English learning through methods like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Behavioristic CALL: Focused on repetitive exercises.</li>
                <li>Communicative CALL: Emphasized implicit grammar teaching and original utterances.</li>
                <li>Integrative CALL: Integrated multiple skills and advanced technologies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Blended learning combines online materials and face-to-face methods, while tools like CALI's Ellis and DynEd's Dynamic English revolutionized teaching.</p>
